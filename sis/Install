			not have a coprocessor (387 etc)

Installation
------------

NOTE: As these archives contain UNIX and/or DOS style text files, you
      must unzip with the -a option.

* Unpack the binaries using:  unzip -a dsis12p1.zip

  The two text files will be extracted into the current directory, the
  binaries will be extracted in a sub-directory called bin.
  You must place this bin directory on your PATH.

* Unpack the sis libraries, using: unzip -a sislib.zip

  The sislib.zip archive unpacks into a subdirectory called sis_lib.

  NOTE: See "Differences" below for filename changes that have had to be
  made.

* set the following environment variables (from the DOS prompt, or in
  autoexec.bat)

	set SIS_LIB=c:/sis_lib      (or whatever)
	set TMPDIR=c:/tmp           (or whatever)
	set HOME=c:/home/paul       (to support '~' expansion)

  NOTE: These directories should use the UNIX-style '/'. All directories
  are held internally in this format and only converted to the '\' form
  when they are presented to DOS.

* Send us an email to let us know you are using this port. We will then
  be able to let you know about any new releases/bug fixes.

Differences between the DOS and UNIX versions
---------------------------------------------

* Some filenames of the help files had to be changed. The changes are
    astg_to_stg.*   -> astg2stg.*  (avoid clash with astg_to_f.*)
    astg_print_sg.* -> astg_sg.*   (avoid clash with astg_print_stat.*)
    print_state.*   -> pr_state.*  (avoid clash with print_stats.*)

* UNIX-style ~ expansion is provided by substituting the value of the
  HOME environment variable. To get the desired effect, each user needs
  to set this appropriately.

* Startup files are called _misrc and _sisrc (rather than .misrc, .sisrc)
  All the standard files are sourced on startup, in $SIS_LIB, $HOME, and
  the current directory.

Things that won't work
----------------------

* The sis commands 'timeout' and 'usage' cannot be usefully supported
  under DOS, so these won't work.
