   |       The file 'dsis12p1.zip' contains a DOS port of the      |
   |     Berkeley SIS software (version 1.2 patch 1) downloaded    |
   |          via anonymous ftp from ic.eecs.berkeley.edu          |
   |                                                               |
   |     Please note that this is not a redistribution of SIS,     |
   |      but a port of a point release to an alternative OS.      |
   |                                                               |
   |    The DOS executables are not distributed by UCB, and UCB    |
   |    will not be responsible for any maintenance or enquires.   |
   |                                                               |
   |  The only supported ftp site for SIS is ic.eecs.berkeley.edu  |
   |                                                               |

     **PLEASE** let us know (by email) if you are using this port.
        This will help us keep track of numbers and allow us to

SIS was written for UNIX systems and ported to DOS using DJ Delorie's
port of gcc. If you would like further details, please contact Paul at
paul@cs.bris.ac.uk.

See the file 'Install' for details on how to install this package and of
some of differences between this DOS port and other versions of SIS.
