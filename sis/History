History file - DOS port of SIS 1.2 pl 1
=======================================

11 June 1995
-----------

* Changed nova code to create tmp files in the current directory, rather
  than /tmp (which would not normally exist under DOS)

* nova (and jedi in exact.c) used system() calls to delete, copy and cat
  files using rm, cp and cat. These programs do not exist under standard
  DOS and system() calls like this are in any case inefficient. All calls
  to rm now use remove(). Wrote two functions copyfile() and catfile() to
  avoid the need to call system() for these operations.

* espresso, nova, jedi, blif2vst and vst2blif are now compiled with -O2
  optimisation.

28 May 1995
-----------

* Corrected "bug" in util_tmpfile.  Temporary files were opened and then
  unlinked (with the FILE* pointer being returned). This doesn't work
  under DOS, where this just results in lost allocation units on the
  disk. Corrected this by saving the filename in a global variable and
  unlinking after the file is finished with. Checked all other calls to
  unlink(). Corrected similar bug in astg/si_encod.c

* Corrected another tmpfile bug in stamina/mimi/read_stg.c

24 May 1995
-----------

* Restructured the sislib.zip and dsis12p1.zip files. Updated the Install
  file to reflect this.

22 May 1995
-----------

* The 'usage' and 'timeout' functions cannot be given useful meanings under
  DOS. These fail (relatively) gracefully with an error message.

* 'time' works as expected. The first time is the elapsed time since the
  last time 'time' was called, and the second time is a wall clock time.
  Both times are in seconds.

* Removed a trailing newline from the command line. This caused problems
  with command line editing and shell-escapes.

* Shell escapes have been made exempt from my '/' to '\' translation. I
  did this because '!dir /w' did not work because the '/w' option was
  converted into a directory. (I can change this back if this behaviour
  is not wanted). It means that directories specified in shell-escapes
  should be DOS-style.

* UNIX-style ~ expansion is supported as far as possible. It expands to
  the value of the HOME environment variable (or / if it isn't set).

* Hence, all the normal startup files are source'd (in this order)
	SIS_LIB/_misrc,  SIS_LIB/_sisrc
	~/_misrc, ~/_sisrc               (eg. set HOME=c:\home\paul)
	./_misrc, ./_sisrc
  This allows a system-wide setup, a per-user setup (if they set HOME) and
  a setup for each working directory.

21 May 1995
-----------

* All directory names are held internally with '/' as the directory
  marker. These are converted to '\' only when the filenames are
  presented to DOS. As far as the user is concerned, all filenames
  should be UNIX style

     eg:       d:/sis-1.2/sis

* Directory lists are separated with '+' rather than ':'

  ':' means something else to DOS (!), and ';' (which is normally
  used in DOS) means something else to SIS. Hence I (arbitrarily)
  chose '+'. This probably won't affect you, but you can do things
  like

      sis> set open_path .+d:/sis-1.2/sis/sis_lib+c:/home/paul

* I have added an environment variable called 'SIS_LIB' to point at
  your default library path. Also, an environment variable TMPDIR is
  used to decide where to store temporary files. These should be
  set, in UNIX style, from the DOS prompt (or autoexec.bat)

     eg    set SIS_LIB=d:/sis-1.2/sis/sis_lib
	   set TMPDIR=c:/tmp

* sis now picks up a start-up file called _sisrc (I have seen a few
  other packages that choose to replace the UNIX dot with a '_', so
  it seemed like as good a choice as any). This file can contain any
  sis commands you like, but normally is used for alias commands

    eg	alias rl read_library

* Help now works!  Typing 'help read_library' at the sis prompt will
  print some documentation. This documentation is in the 'help'
  subdirectory of sis_lib.

  NB. Because the help files (*.fmt) are viewed using DOS 'type' and
  'more', they must have DOS style linefeeds. zip -a will do this
  transformation for you if you haven't done it already.

16 May 1995
-----------

* New versions uploaded with go32 included, rather that stub.exe.
  (required for stand-alone operation).

1 May 1995
----------

* First port completed and uploaded to SBU.
